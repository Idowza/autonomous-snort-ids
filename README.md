AI-Enhanced Autonomous IDS

A Cybersecurity Capstone Project using Snort 3 and Python for the University of North Dakota (EECS 994).
About The Project

This repository contains the code for an AI-enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The system uses Snort 3 to detect network threats with custom rules and a Python-based machine learning pipeline to classify the resulting alerts. The ultimate goal is to create an autonomous system that can suggest new detection rules in response to emerging threats.
